“Every day you have a new chapter to write about your journey of life. As you write that chapter do it so well such that if others read it, you would still be proud of yourself.”

There are many different theories about the structure of a novel but don't actually adhere to any of them, except for one.<br><br> That is, everything you can and will write has three parts:<br> a beginning,<br>
a middle, <br>and an end. <br>This is an unavoidable reality.<br> Your novel, of course,
will have a beginning and it will absolutely have an end and everything in between,
well, that must be the middle. So your novel will be divided into these three parts or sections and we
will borrow from the wisdom of ancient Greece and Aristotle's definition of a tragedy, which also applies to a comedy and everything in between. <br>In which he stated that everything indeed has a beginning, a middle, and an end. He described it as being divided into three acts.<br><br>
The first act is the beginning, <br>the second act is the middle,<br> and the third act is,
of course, the end. <br><br>Refer to acts 1, 2 and 3 and they could easily be called sections 1, 2 and 3 or parts 1,2, and 3. But we will use Aristotle's precedent and call them acts. We will also divide our work into chapters.<br> Lets say we will write 20 chapters
and each chapter will have about 2,500 words so that you will finish with
a complete 50,000 word novel.<br> The chapter count and page count needs to be precise in order for the class to function at its best. <br><br>Once you begin, you will write a chapter every week.
This means you will write 2,500 words a week and we will break that down to
a daily word count, a 500 words.<br><br> Meaning that, regardless of what else you have going on in your life, you need to find the time to sit down and write 500 words a day,
five days a week.<br> In the end, your chapters don't need to have 2500 words and your novel
doesn't need to have 20 chapters. But in order to make it through and finish your novel,
as you are a beginner, you need to adhere to this regimen. <br><br>When you're all done, you might realign your chapter breaks and
decrease or increase their number.<br><br><hr>
Something that new writers usually haven't considered but all successful writers adhere to
is the need for <b>discipline</b>.<br> If you want to make it through to the completion of your novel,
you must take on the regimen of a professional writer and set a daily word count and achieve that count every day. <br>Five hundred words is just one page of typing, a single-page on a word processor like Microsoft Word. So you will write just one page a day.<br>
<br>If you have a busy life, having a full-time job, taking care of your family, being a full-time student,
or perhaps all three, this may be demanding, but somehow you must put aside the time to write one page a day, five times a week. It's only one page, but sometimes that can seem like a lot and then for some of you, 500 words a day may seem like not enough. Maybe you could write a 1,000 or more words a day and you can do that if you want, but this is very important.

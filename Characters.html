Before you begin to write, you need to spend some time developing your main character or characters.Your characters can be based on anything or anyone, but it would highly recommend
that you base them on someone you know or have experienced in some way.<br>
Its highly recommend against basing your character on an existing character in a book, or a movie, or a TV show. Better to base them on a relative, or friend, or someone you met once,
or even someone you overheard in a coffee shop. Now, its not suggested that your cousin,
Bobby should be the protagonist of your story, but you can build off some of the traits that cousin Bobby has.<br> The way he speaks,his passion for video games, his careless driving, his fear of commitment. <br><br>Take something real and develop it. Just as you need to develop your overall idea,
you need to develop your main characters and all other characters. There are no bad characters,
just poorly developed ones. So think about your main characters and write a detailed description of them, and answer all questions that you can think of. So that you can really get inside the minds of your characters.So they always do, think, act, respond the way that that character always would.
<br><br>So who is that person who just moved to a new city? What's their name? How old are they? Are they married? Do they have children? Are they likable? What's their job?
Special traits? Are they a loner?<br> Carrying around the effects from the past experience, like a relationship, betrayal, a lost love, a bad choice in life?<br><br>
Get to know who your characters are.<br><br>
If you do, if you have a true understanding of who they really are, then everything they say and
do will be true unto themselves. Their words and actions will be plausible to people reading your novel.

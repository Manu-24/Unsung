		To begin, you need to come up with an idea that will become your own
intellectual property, or IP, as the basis for your novel.<br><br>
Some of you may already have an idea for your IP.
For others, the question you may be asking yourself is what should I write about?<br>
A very good question.<br>
And there's a simple answer.<br> </center>
You should write about anything at all, anything.<br><br>
1...You take any idea and develop it into something plausible.<br>
2...Developing the idea is what's important.
Moreso than the idea itself, really.
3...Take any idea and just start writing about it.<br>

<b>EXAMPLE
</b><br><br>An author named Nicholson Baker wrote an entire novel about a 30 second
escalator ride.<br>
You can start with something like I love sandwiches.<br>
So you've just moved to new city and
you've been invited to a party in an older high-rise hotel.<br>
Before you leave, you have a craving for a sandwich but
the only bread you have is a stale.
It's rock hard.<br>
So you think it might be okay if you toast it.<br>
But when you try to slice the baguette, it's so hard that your knife slips off and
slices your thumb instead.<br>
Now, you should go to the doc. But you just put a band-aid on it,
which continues to leak blood.<br>
You go to the party.
You shake a lot of hands and some people give you a welcome hug.
And one of them is a nurse.<br>
She turns out to be a drug dealer who gets killed in a drive-by shooting that night.
And some of your blood was found on her clothing.<br>
The police track your DNA.
You get sent to prison.
You become part of a prison gang and...., I don't know,
sounds like it has some potential.<br><br>
And it started out as a story about your passion for sandwiches.<br><br>
</fieldset>
<center>The point is that you never know how good an idea might be until you
start to develop it.<hr size=5 color=black>
So now pitch your idea, that is,
write it up in just a paragraph or a few sentences.<br>
And remember, any idea can be developed into something really good.<hr size=5 color=black>

Every time you start writing any new chapter.
Once again, you must outline what you intend to
do with and pitch it.<br><br>
Now, at the end of every chapter,
you left your readers absolutely compelled
to turn the page and begin next chapter.<br>
Well, don't disappoint them.<br>
Make them feel very happy to have turned the page.<br>
It is suggested you plan on starting the chapter by
giving them something unexpected.
<br>Grab your reader's sense of intrigue from
the end of previous chapter and escalate it.
<br>You don't necessarily need to just continue on
the same path line from the end of chapter one.
There was a reason to
end your first chapter where you did,
and there must be a compelling reason
to begin a new chapter.<br><br><b>
Whatever the stakes are,
you need to raise them.</b><br><br>
This may be sounding like you should be
writing an action thriller,
but that's not what I'm saying.<br>
Writing in this way applies as much to a novel about
internal annexed as it does to a sci-fi space war.<br>
A love story can and should
be every bit as intriguing as a spy thriller.
<br><br>It's all about engagement.
Keep the reader engaged.<hr size=5 color=black>
With that in mind, Write your next chapters and complete your book.
<br><br>HAPPY WRITING!

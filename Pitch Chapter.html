It's time to start thinking seriously about the chapters of your book (specially 1st, The first chapter could make or break your novel.) .<br> Before you begin to write it, you need to pitch your chapter.That is describe it in about a half a page to a maximum of one page.
This is a very critical stage in the development of your book. 

<br> You don't need much detail and you can leave out style and nuance. Just write an outline of how the chapter begins and ends and what happens in between.
<br><br></center>1...Do not draw comparisons between your story and anything you've read or seen.
<br>2...Do not say that it starts out like Game of Thrones. Or that it's written in the style of Ernest Hemingway. <br><br><center>It is your story, your original intellectual property.
And you are a unique writer.<br><br>
Before you can pitch your chapter, you'll need to have an idea of how long the chapter should be.</center>
So if you're a beginner...<br>1...You can aim for about 2,500 words.<br>2...Write in basic manuscript form.<br>
3...Normal margins, 12 point font, all double-spaced. <br> That will amount to about 10 pages of manuscript. Which will in turn translate to about 15 pages of a book.<center> <br><br> You've pitched your story. <br><br>
You've written your logline. <br><br>Devised your dramatic question. <br>And created a profile for your main characters.<br> <br>Good, now before writting any chapter, describe each chapter in a pitch.
Starting with chapter 1...

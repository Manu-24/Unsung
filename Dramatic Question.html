So here's another challenging topic. Define the dramatic question.<br> This is somewhat related to the law of blind in that it is short and concise. But it doesn't describe the story itself. Instead, it is the question you hope to plant in your reader's minds from the outset so that virtually everything that happens in your story keeps your readers engaged to find the answer to that essential question.<br><br>
The logline for Romeo and Juliet mentioned previously, two young lovers from rival families in medieval Italy make the dangerous decision to elope when their marriage is forbidden by both families. It sets up the story but does not ask a question.<br> By the way, you should have
never include a question in a logline. <br>The dramatic question might be, will Romeo and Juliet find love and happiness together despite the fact that their rival families have vowed to keep them apart?
<br><br>So the logline is for public consumption and can be included in your presentation, your pitch to an agent or publisher, or as part of the description on the jacket of your novel.<BR><br>
The dramatic question however, is only known by you, the writer, something you plant in the reader's minds and it's your responsibility to make sure that it stays there until the end of the story,
and it should always be in your mind as you write.<br><br> So now revisit your logline and your concept pitch. Glean the dramatic question from them. There is only one major dramatic question
and you have to find it, articulate it, and live by it.<br><br>
 Your logline and dramatic question together will do a lot to get you to the essence of your story. Get these two things right; the logline and dramatic question and you will have a solid foundation on which to build your novel.

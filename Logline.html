Before you begin to write your novel, you need to write a logline.<br> So what is a logline?<br>Well, this is a term that's usually applied to films or TV series but it's a surprisingly effective tool to help you get
a good grasp and understanding of what your novel is all about. So a logline is a very short, very condensed version of the story that describes the essence of the novel or movie or TV show, etc.<br>It's like an elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is defined as trying to sell your idea to someone during an elevator ride before they reach their floor. But that would be far too long for a logline.<br>
This is more of a pitch that you could give someone who is riding the down escalator and you're on the way up.It's one sentence and one sentence only. <br>For instance, the logline for Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet might be <br><b>"two young lovers from rival families in medieval Italy make
the dangerous decision to elope when their marriage is forbidden by both families."</b><br>
So this is a good logline. It describes the main characters in their dilemma,
hints at perilous risk in their action, sets the families as villains, and gives the sense of time and place which implies social and cultural restrictions. It really doesn't give away the plot, avoids detail, and importantly does no reveal the things dramatic ending.<br><br>
Writing a logline is a very challenging experience but it's important and beneficial to you as a writer. Loglines are often written after the project is finished but by distilling the essence of your story into a single sentence before you begin will likely help you to gain a lot of insight and understanding of your project before you've written the first word of your novel.<br><br>
This doesn't mean that you figured out the nuances of the story or how it ends. It will simply give others and yourself a clear understanding of what the story is all about.<br>
Also, the logline can and probably will change as your story evolves.<br>

# UnSung
I made this Long time ago.  
The idea was to make a website where people can login and upload their work (novel,stories,poems,etc.). Other people can review, read etc.
But It's not at all completed.   
Why I named it UnSung? UnSung means not celebrated or praised.
Idea was to make it for upcoming writers or anyone who wants to start.
To Run...make UnSungIntro.html run on chrome.
